# WP Cookie Notice

This is a Wordpress plugin that adds a cookie notice. The notice is shown on every page until the user clicks the "Accept" button. This plugin uses implicit consent, meaning that it does not prevent any use of cookies before the user accepts. The notice message and the color scheme can be changed in the settings page, and further customization can be accomplished in your theme with the use of the `wpcn` classes.

## Requirements

- Wordpress
- NPM

## Getting Started

1. Run `npm install` from the plugin's root directory.
2. Run `npm run-script build` to build the assets once, or run `npm run-script start` to keep a watcher going.
